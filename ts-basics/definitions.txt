Type annotations -> Code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to (we tell Ts)

Type inference -> TS automatically tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to (TS does on its own)


variable declaration         variable initialization
     const color          =          "red";
if declaration and initialization are on the same line then Typescript will automatically figure out the type of color(var)

we rely on type inference alwayss!!

we rely on type annotations especially on 
1 -> when variable is declared and is initialized later;
2 -> when we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
3 -> when a function return "any" type and we need to clarify the value


# Typed arrays -> Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value
